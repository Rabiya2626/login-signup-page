# My Login & Signup Page

Hey there,  
I built this Login and Signup webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s a small project where you can create an account, log in, and see a welcome page.  
A fun way to practice frontend development.


## Features

Signup Page  
Create a new account with email and password.  
Password must have at least one number, one lowercase letter, and one special character.  
Shows a red warning if the email is already used.

Login Page  
Login only if your email is registered and password is correct.  
Shows an alert if credentials are wrong.  
Redirects to a welcome page on success.

Welcome Page  
Greets you after a successful login.  
You can logout and return to login.



## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
2. If you don’t have an account, go to Create Account.  
3. After signing up, login with your email and password.  
4. Enjoy the welcome page.  


## Files Included

`index.html` – Contains signup, login, and welcome sections  
`style.css` – For styling forms and layout  
`script.js` – Handles signup, login, validation, and switching pages  


This project is a fun way to learn frontend basics, validation, and simple user flows.  
Hope you enjoy playing with it!
